# Usage

To quickly modify and run this example cookbook:

1. Download this `algosec-chef-example` folder by clicking [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/AlmogCohen/algosec-chef/tree/master/examples/algosec-chef-example). 
2. Unzip it.
3. Download the `algosec` cookbook dependency from the Chef Supermarket:
      
    ```bash
    $ cd algosec-chef-example/cookbooks
    # (Now we're in algosec-chef-example/cookbooks)
    
    # Now download the cookbook tar, untar to a folder, and delete the tar file
    $ knife cookbook site download algosec; tar -xvf algosec-*.tar.gz; rm algosec-*.tar.gz
    
    # Now the algosec cookbook lives at chef-example/cookbooks/algosec
    ```
 
4. Edit the content of [cookbooks/my_algosec/recipes/default.rb](cookbooks/my_algosec/recipes/default.rb):
    1. Edit the `algosec` credentials hash.
    2. Edit the `application_flows` definition as you wish.
5. Run the cookbook default recipe using Chef Zero:
    
    ```bash
    $ chef-client -z -o my_algosec::default
    ```

6. As the cookbook is being run the first time, you can see how it automatically download AlgoSec's ruby SDK gem.

That's it! You can re-run the recipe as many times as you'd like, adding or changing properties, and it will ensure what you set in the recipe is reflected on the AlgoSec. You can update the password, add permissions, or create additional resources.
