# Usage

To quickly modify and run this example cookbook:

1. Download this `complete-example` folder by clicking [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/AlmogCohen/algosec-chef/tree/master/examples/complete-example), unzip it, and `cd` into the folder.
2. Download the `algosec` cookbook dependency from the Chef Supermarket:
      
    ```bash
    $ cd cookbooks
    # (Now we're in complete-example/cookbooks)
    
    $ knife cookbook site download algosec
    
    # Now we need to untar the download:
    $ tar -xvf algosec-*.tar.gz
    # Now the algosec cookbook lives at chef-example/cookbooks/algosec
    
    # You can remove the tar file if you'd like; we no longer need it
    $ rm algosec-*.tar.gz
    ```
 
3. Edit the content of [cookbooks/my_algosec/recipes/default.rb](cookbooks/my_algosec/recipes/default.rb):
    1. Edit the `algosec` credentials hash.
    2. Edit the `application_flows` definition as you wish.
4. Run the cookbook default recipe using Chef Zero:
    
    ```bash
    $ chef-client -z -o my_algosec::default
    ```
